C0036410,Sclera,"The white, opaque, fibrous, outer tunic of the eyeball, covering it entirely excepting the segment covered anteriorly by the cornea. It is essentially avascular but contains apertures for vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. It receives the tendons of insertion of the extraocular muscles and at the corneoscleral junction contains the canal of Schlemm. (From Cline et al., Dictionary of Visual Science, 4th ed)"

C0042160,Uvea,"The pigmented vascular coat of the eyeball, consisting of the CHOROID; CILIARY BODY; and IRIS, which are continuous with each other. (Cline et al., Dictionary of Visual Science, 4th ed)"
C0003151,Anterior chamber of eye structure,"The space in the eye, filled with aqueous humor, bounded anteriorly by the cornea and a small portion of the sclera and posteriorly by a small portion of the ciliary body, the iris, and that part of the crystalline lens which presents through the pupil. (Cline et al., Dictionary of Visual Science, 4th ed, p109)"

(Cline et al., Dictionary of Visual Science, 4th ed, p109)"
C1708516,Inner Canthus,The medial corner of the eye where the upper and lower eyelids join.
C0600518,Choroidal Neovascularization,A pathological process consisting of the formation of new blood vessels in the CHOROID.
C1504336,Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy,A CHOROID neovascularization characterized by serosanguineous retinal pigment epithelial detachment and leakage of serous exudate sometimes associated with aneurysmal polypoidal lesions.
C0339543,Epiretinal Membrane,"A membrane on the vitreal surface of the retina resulting from the proliferation of one or more of three retinal elements: (1) fibrous astrocytes; (2) fibrocytes; and (3) RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM. Localized epiretinal membranes may occur at the posterior pole of the eye without clinical signs or may cause marked loss of vision as a result of covering, distorting, or detaching the FOVEA CENTRALIS. Epiretinal membranes may cause vascular leakage and secondary retinal edema. In younger individuals some membranes appear to be developmental in origin and occur in otherwise normal eyes. The majority occur in association with RETINAL HOLES, ocular concussions, retinal inflammation, or after ocular surgery. (Newell, Ophthalmology: Principles and Concepts, 7th ed, p291)"
C0339543,Epiretinal Membrane,"Wrinkling or bulging of contracted scar tissue that has formed on retinal surface secondary to retinal injury, inflammation, blood vessel occlusion, or vitreous detachment."
C0154830,Proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"Advanced retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus characterized by the formation of new vessels in the retina. The new vessels are abnormal and fragile. If hemorrhage occurs due to the vascular fragility, there is increased risk of vision loss or blindness."
C0154830,Proliferative diabetic retinopathy,the eye problem in the people with diabetes mellitus that causes loss of vision
C0017601,Glaucoma,Increased pressure in the eyeball due to obstruction of the outflow of aqueous humor.
C0017601,Glaucoma,"An ocular disease, occurring in many forms, having as its primary characteristics an unstable or a sustained increase in the intraocular pressure which the eye cannot withstand without damage to its structure or impairment of its function. The consequences of the increased pressure may be manifested in a variety of symptoms, depending upon type and severity, such as excavation of the optic disk, hardness of the eyeball, corneal anesthesia, reduced visual acuity, seeing of colored halos around lights, disturbed dark adaptation, visual field defects, and headaches. (Dictionary of Visual Science, 4th ed)"
C0042164,Uveitis,"Inflammation of part or all of the uvea, the middle (vascular) tunic of the eye, and commonly involving the other tunics (sclera and cornea, and the retina). (Dorland, 27th ed)"
C0042164,Uveitis,"An inflammatory process affecting a part of or the entire uvea. Causes include inflammatory agents (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster, leptospirosis) and systemic diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis). Patients present with pain and redness in the eye, light sensitivity, and blurred and decreased vision."

C0010043,Corneal Ulcer,Area of epithelial tissue loss from corneal surface; associated with inflammatory cells in the cornea and anterior chamber.
C0010043,Corneal Ulcer,"Loss of epithelial tissue from the surface of the cornea due to progressive erosion and necrosis of the tissue; usually caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral infection."
C0013238,Dry Eye Syndromes,"Corneal and conjunctival dryness due to deficient tear production, predominantly in menopausal and post-menopausal women. Filamentary keratitis or erosion of the conjunctival and corneal epithelium may be caused by these disorders. Sensation of the presence of a foreign body in the eye and burning of the eyes may occur."
C0013238,Dry Eye Syndromes,A syndrome characterized by dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva. It is usually caused by a deficiency in tear production. Symptoms include a feeling of burning eyes and a possible foreign body presence in the eye.

C0030353,Papilledema,"Swelling of the OPTIC DISK, usually in association with increased intracranial pressure, characterized by hyperemia, blurring of the disk margins, microhemorrhages, blind spot enlargement, and engorgement of retinal veins. Chronic papilledema may cause OPTIC ATROPHY and visual loss. (Miller et al., Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology, 4th ed, p175)"
C0030353,Papilledema,"Swelling around the optic disc, usually due to increased intracranial pressure or pressure on the optic nerve by a tumor."
