vessel distortion: blood vessels on the retinal surface may appear twisted or distorted
rpe detachment: small lifting or separation of the layer beneath the retina
hemorrhages: small to large blood spots scattered across the retina
intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA): abnormal tiny blood vessels growing in the retina
no signs of choroidal neovascularization: absence of abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina
retinal fluid: signs of fluid leakage in the retina
subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM): bright, reflective material beneath the retina, indicating bleeding or fibrosis
distorted retinal layers: the normal layering of the retina appears disrupted or wavy
cotton wool spots: fluffy white patches on the retina, indicating localized damage
drusen: small bumps under the retina layer
cystoid macular edema: small, cyst-like spaces of fluid in the macula
choroidal thinning: the layer beneath the retina looks thinner, sometimes with visible underlying sclera
ganglion cell layer thinning: the layer containing the eye's ganglion cells becomes thinner
macular thickening: the central part of the retina, the macula, looks thicker than normal
geographic atrophy: large areas of retina loss, causing blind spots
retinal distortion: straight lines may appear wavy or curved due to the membrane's pull on the retina
bright lesions: light-colored spots or areas on the retina
retinal edema: swelling or thickening of the retina
microaneurysms: small red dots on the retina, usually the earliest sign
retinal detachment: the retina slightly lifts or bulges due to fluid underneath
hyperreflective foci: small, bright spots in the retina, possibly indicating inflammation or exudation
rpe changes: uneven or thin areas in the layer under the retina
posterior pole asymmetry: differences in the appearance of the retina and optic nerve between the two eyes
rpe atrophy: thinning of the layer under the retina
optic nerve head cupping: increased depth and size of the cup in the optic nerve head
subretinal fluid: fluid accumulation under the retina
hard exudates: small, yellowish-white spots on the retina
dot and blot hemorrhages: small to medium-sized red spots scattered across the retina
blurred spot: a blurry or distorted area in the central vision
uniform retinal pigment epithelium (RPE): the layer beneath the retina appears even and intact
retinal atrophy: thinning of the retina, mainly in the center
retinal thinning: the retina becomes thinner, especially in the center
bayoneting of blood vessels: blood vessels appear to bend sharply as they cross the optic disc
pigment epithelial detachment (PED): a lifting or separation of the layer under the retina
clear, defined optic disc: the area where nerve fibers exit the eye appears bright and well-defined, with no swelling or pallor
absence of hemorrhages or exudates: no signs of bleeding or yellowish-white deposits
blood vessel dilation: veins in the retina appear wider and more tortuous
disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL): the layers of the retina appear disorganized or disrupted
retinal hemorrhage: small to large patches of bleeding in the retina
no signs of edema or fluid: the retina appears flat and lacks any swelling or fluid accumulation
consistent retinal color: uniform coloration of the retina without any unusual spots or lesions
pre-retinal or vitreous hemorrhage: bleeding in front of or within the vitreous humor of the eye
regular blood vessels: blood vessels have a consistent caliber and course without abnormal twisting or dilation
peripapillary atrophy: a pale ring around the optic disc
no drusen or abnormal growths: the absence of small yellowish spots (drusen) or any abnormal growths beneath the retina
normal macular thickness: the central part of the retina (macula) is of a consistent and normal thickness
absence of fluid or cysts: no pockets of fluid or cyst-like spaces within or under the retina
regular optic nerve head: the area where the optic nerve exits the eye appears normal without cupping or swelling
optic disc swelling: the optic nerve head appears swollen
choroidal neovascularization: abnormal new blood vessels growing under the retina
